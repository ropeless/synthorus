    "## What is Synthorus\n",
    "\n",
    "Synthorus is a software library for creating synthetic data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The library is provided as a Python package (called `synthorus`). There is an additional package containing demonstration Python scripts (called `synthorus_demos`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Aim\n",
    "\n",
    "The aims of Synthorus are:\n",
    "  - to provide a Python library for building synthetic data simulators\n",
    "    based on probabilistic graphical models\n",
    "  - to be efficient, flexible, and easy to use\n",
    "  - to exhibit excellent design, code, and documentation\n",
    "  - to support researchers and businesses wanting to explore and use\n",
    "    synthetic data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key features\n",
    "\n",
    "- unlimited synthetic data from a Synthorus simulator\n",
    "- can produce synthetic data for relational data models (i.e., multiple data entities), with guaranteed referential integrity\n",
    "- integrated privacy protection using Differential Privacy and cryptographically secure random number generator\n",
    "- integrated accuracy evaluation of synthetic data for verifying synthetic data utility\n",
    "- based on probabilistic graphical models for mathematically verifiable statistical properties\n",
    "- coded in pure Python\n",
    "- fast, flexible and efficient.\n"
