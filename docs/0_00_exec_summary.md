# Synthorus #

_reliable synthetic data for complex systems_

## What it is ##

Synthetic data is artificial data that is generated by algorithms to represent some real-world or hypothetical system.

Synthorus (rhymes with "thesaurus") is open source software
to support researchers and businesses wanting to explore and use synthetic data.

Synthetic data can be applied to many use cases that require safe and realistic data. Use cases include:
- education and training
- testing workflows, algorithms and data processing pipelines
- training machine learning models.

Synthetic data is particularly valuable when real-world data is rare, expensive or confidential.

Synthorus is provided as a Python package that is [easily installed](https://pypi.org/project/synthorus/) and
comes with [comprehensive documentation](https://synthorus.readthedocs.io/) to support creating simple
or advanced synthetic data.

## What it offers ##

Synthorus allows a synthetic data engineer to build a Synthorus simulator using a combination of reference data
(a.k.a. training data) and mathematical background knowledge, depending on your project.

The process of building a simulator from reference
data is integrated with privacy protection using Differential Privacy and cryptographically secure random numbers.

Synthorus supports the evaluation of the statistical properties of a simulator, for verifying synthetic data utility.
At its core, Synthorus uses [Probabilistic Graphical Models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_model)
for mathematically verifiable statistical properties.

A simulator can produce synthetic data for relational data models (i.e., multiple data entities), with
guaranteed referential integrity.

Once a simulator is built, it can be used to produce unlimited synthetic data. Generating extra data does not
affect privacy risk. This is because privacy and accuracy guarantees are made for a simulator. Any synthetic data
generated from a Synthorus simulator inherits the guarantees made about the simulator.

Synthorus is written in pure Python making it very accessible to data analysts and engineers.
It is fast, flexible and efficient.

## What it costs ##

Synthorus is provided free using the [MIT Licence](https://opensource.org/license/mit).
This licence makes it easy for developers and companies to use, modify, and distribute Synthorus source code.

Many may think nothing is ever truly free. In some sense that is true. 
In this case, you need to be confident you can handle the pitfalls and risks involved
in _any_ use of synthetic data.
If you want support with the use of synthetic data, or you would like any Synthorus customisation, please
contact the [Synthorus Team](mailto:info@synthorus.org).

## Why trust it ##

Trust is built from many aspects. Synthorus invites trust in three ways.
1. The core mechanism for generating synthetic data is the use of probabilistic graphical models.
   These models have guaranteed statistical properties that can be mathematically relied on
   to support claims of statistical correctness.
2. Synthorus is designed with privacy protection as its foundation. It is fully integrated with
   Differential Privacy and cryptographically secure random number generation.
3. Being [open-source](https://github.com/ropeless/synthorus), the algorithms and implementation
   of Synthorus are visible to all. The Synthorus developers are open to scrutiny and welcome feedback.
