    "A developer installation will normally clone the origin repository. The project source code is available at https://github.com/ropeless/synthorus.\n",

    "The project uses [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) to manage Python dependencies.\n",

    "To get started...\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Clone the repository, e.g., using `git clone https://github.com/ropeless/synthorus.git` or `git clone git@github.com:ropeless/synthorus.git`.\n",
    "2. Install Python dependencies using poetry: `poetry sync`.\n",
    "   If poetry fails you may need to first run `python -m ensurepip --upgrade` for some versions of Python, to ensure `pip` is operational.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Python script called `synthorus_demos/all_demos.py` is available to run most demo scripts in Synthorus (with some exclusions for practical reasons). This can be used as a smoke test.\n",

    "A Python script called `tests/all_test.py` is available to run all unit tests in Synthorus. The script `tests/all_coverage.py` is available to run all unit tests with code coverage analysis.\n",

    "To build a copy of the Jupyter Book documentation, run the Python script `build_docs.py`.\n",
