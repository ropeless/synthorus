# Some modules and demonstration scripts require local configuration,
# e.g., for writing output files. Those modules and code will
# access the local configuration here via `synthorus.utils.config_help`.
#
# Copy this file to `config.py` and update the contents and needed.
# Ensure that `config.py` is in your Python path.
#
# Alternatively, you can set OS environment variables.
